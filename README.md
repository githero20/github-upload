# YelpCamp_O!

> Yelp! clone, but for campgrounds/resorts.

This is a full stack, CRUD web application from Colt Steele's "Web Developer Bootcamp" course on [Udemy]. A crowd-sourced review web application, about various campgrounds/resorts across the globe, showing their locations, descriptions and reviews from users. It includes, geocoding, user authentication and image uploading features. 

Building this from scratch provided me with a proper introduction to Web Development. I am grateful to Colt for his great teaching skills and to my friend Jeremiah for introducing me to this course.

Just so you know, this app holds a special place in my heart because it was my first. I hope you enjoy it!
